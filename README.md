# bunchiefo

A computer-human interface project, aiming to design a six-axis input device based on magnetometers and rubber bands.

The general idea is to suspend some magnets mounted on a rigid ring around some magnetometers, and let the transistors sort out what the orientation and position of the ring is.

## Geometry Finder
This chunk of the project aims to let the computer discover a "good" geometry for the sensor and magnet setup.
